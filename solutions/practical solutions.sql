/*Practical solutions
1. If communities are using rivers, we can dispatch trucks to those regions to provide water temporarily in the short term, while we send out
crews to drill for wells, providing a more permanent solution.
2. If communities are using wells, we can install filters to purify the water. For wells with biological contamination, we can install UV filters that
kill microorganisms, and for *polluted wells*, we can install reverse osmosis filters. In the long term, we need to figure out why these sources
are polluted.
3. For shared taps, in the short term, we can send additional water tankers to the busiest taps, on the busiest days. We can use the queue time
pivot table we made to send tankers at the busiest times. Meanwhile, we can start the work on installing extra taps where they are needed.
According to UN standards, the maximum acceptable wait time for water is 30 minutes. With this in mind, our aim is to install taps to get
queue times below 30 min.
4. Shared taps with short queue times (< 30 min) represent a logistical challenge to further reduce waiting times. The most effective solution,
installing taps in homes, is resource-intensive and better suited as a long-term goal.
5. Addressing broken infrastructure offers a significant impact even with just a single intervention. It is expensive to fix, but so many people
can benefit from repairing one facility. For example, fixing a reservoir or pipe that multiple taps are */
